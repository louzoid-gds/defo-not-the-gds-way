# defo-not-the-gds-way
An attempt to alter the info architecture of the GDS Way to be more navigable.

Based upon a fresh clone of the [GDS tech docs template](https://github.com/alphagov/tdt-documentation). Refer to this guidance to run locally.

## Why did I do this?
The GDS Way is awesome but because of its organic growth, the structure of the content is far from ideal. This has resulted in some duplication and quality content buried.

I've taken the existing content and munged it into a multipage structure using the tech docs template. The information architecture is purely from my brain and not based upon research. I would advocate for a card sorting exercise to determine the optimal strucutre.

As I've copied pages over, I've altered some of the content. I've done this where I've found duplicated content or structures that just do not make sense in the new format. Happy to share a spreadsheet which has these changes tracked.

The really bad thing I've done is alter some h2s to be h3s. I've done this because the new multipage nav goes down to 2 levels and sometimes is just too large for the amount of h2s we have at the moment. I think this can be remedied by looking at the content in question and defining new headers where it makes sense to do so. The programming language style guides section has been victim to most of this and I've popped some 'contents' sections near the top to ensure the content is still navigable.

## Next steps
I don't think we should use this attempt as a new GDS Way, but rather as an example of how the GDS Way might look with an altered content structure.

Feedback is very very welcome :)
