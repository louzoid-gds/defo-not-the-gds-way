# How to manage DNS records for your service

To ensure users can connect to your service, you’ll need accurate Domain Name System (DNS) records and a DNS provider to supply your DNS nameservers.

You can find information on choosing where to host your DNS and how to request nameserver delegation at GDS in the [Service Manual][].

As part of your DNS strategy and planning you need to ensure your:

* DNS entry configuration (stored for example in a zone file using JSON or YAML) is version controlled unless it’s autogenerated
* overall service strategy includes nameserver high availability, for example deploy publishing.service.gov.uk to both Amazon Route 53 and Google Cloud DNS

When you implement your DNS strategy you should consider using:

* [Amazon Route 53][] as a cloud DNS web service
* [Google Cloud DNS][] for high nameserver availability
* version control to publish your records using tools such as [GOV.UK DNS][] or [octoDNS][]

You can read more about [service domains and DNS][] in the Service Manual.
